- UNZIP THE IMAGE FILES BEFORE YOU RUN ANY OF THIS CODE!!

- image_recropper and image_resizer were used to clean the data beforehand.

- id_scraper was used to gather a dataset (sourced from my own YouTube channel)

- parchment_generator combines all image outputs into a contiguous image (parchment.png)

- vc_analyzer provides basic statistics on the image data and their associated viewcounts
